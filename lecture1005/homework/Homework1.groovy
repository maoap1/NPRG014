//TASK Build a processor for user scripts that will be provided in plain text at runtime.
//On the input the processor receives a list of urls and a user script that performs user-defined filtering of these urls.
//The processor should return urls of the websites that were returned by the user script.
//The user scripts must be allowed to use custom commands - 'download', 'unless', siteTalksAboutGroovy', 'remember' and 'rememberedSites'.
//The semantics of these commands can be deduced from the 'test user script input', defined at the bottom of this assignment.
//Use the tricks we learnt about scripting, passing parameters to GroovyShell through binding, properties, 
//closure delegates, the 'object.with(Closure)' method, etc.
